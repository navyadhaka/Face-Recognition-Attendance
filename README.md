# Face-Recognition-Attendance
This project is an AI-powered attendance system that automates the process of marking attendance using facial recognition. It integrates OpenCV for real-time face detection and InsightFace for identity verification, ensuring fast and accurate recognition.

## Features

- **Automated Attendance**: No manual marking required.
- **Real Time Face Detection** using OpenCV.
- **Identity Verification** using InsightFace.
- **Image Pre-processing** for improved accuracy (resizing, resolution enhancement).

## Requirements
Install the required Python dependencies:
```sh
pip install deepface opencv-python pillow numpy torch torchvision
```

## Technologies Used
- **OpenCV**: Object detection and image preprocessing.
- **InsightFace**: Face recognition.
- **NumPy**: Array handling.
